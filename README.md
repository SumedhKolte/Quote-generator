## Introduction

This web page, titled "Javascript Quote Generator," is a minimalistic application designed to display inspirational quotes to users. When the user clicks the "New Quote" button, a random quote and its author are displayed on the page.

## How It Works

### HTML (index.html)
The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page and includes the necessary elements such as headings, a button to generate quotes, and placeholders for the quote and author.

### CSS (style.css)
The CSS file provides the styling for the web page, including background images, text formatting, and button styles. It enhances the visual appeal of the application.

### JavaScript (index.js)
The JavaScript file contains the logic for generating random quotes. It defines an array of quotes, each with an author and a corresponding quote. When the "New Quote" button is clicked, a random quote from the array is selected and displayed on the web page.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
